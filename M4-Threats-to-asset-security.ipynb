    "## Social engineering tactics\n",
    "\n",
    "Social engineering attacks are a popular choice among threat actors. That’s because it’s often easier to trick people into providing them with access, information, or money than it is to exploit a software or network vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might recall, **social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. It's an umbrella term that can apply to a broad range of attacks. Each technique is designed to capitalize on the trusting nature of people and their willingness to help. In this reading, you will learn about specific social engineering tactics to watch out for. You’ll also learn ways that organizations counter these threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Social engineering risks\n",
    "Social engineering is a form of deception that takes advantage of the way people think. It preys on people’s natural feelings of curiosity, generosity, and excitement. Threat actors turn those feelings against their targets by affecting their better judgment. Social engineering attacks can be incredibly harmful because of how easy they can be to accomplish.\n",

Threat actors turn those feelings against their targets by affecting their better judgment. Social engineering attacks can be incredibly harmful because of how easy they can be to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the highest-profile social engineering attacks that occurred in recent years was the Twitter Hack of 2020. During that incident, a group of hackers made phone calls to Twitter employees pretending to be from the IT department. Using this basic scam, the group managed to gain access to the organization’s network and internal tools. This allowed them to take over the accounts of high-profile users, including politicians, celebrities, and entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attacks like this are just one example of the chaos threat actors can create using basic social engineering techniques. These attacks present serious risks because they don’t require sophisticated computer skills to perform. Defending against them requires a multi-layered approach that combines technological controls with user awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signs of an attack\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes, people are unable to tell that an attack is happening until it's too late. Social engineering is such a dangerous threat because it typically allows attackers to bypass technological defenses that are in their way. Although these threats are difficult to prevent, recognizing the signs of social engineering is a key to reducing the likelihood of a successful attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are common types of social engineering to watch out for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baiting** is a social engineering tactic that tempts people into compromising their security. A common example is USB baiting that relies on someone finding an infected USB drive and plugging it into their device.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phishing** is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. It is one of the most common forms of social engineering, typically performed via email.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quid pro quo** is a type of baiting used to trick someone into believing that they’ll be rewarded in return for sharing access, information, or money. For example, an attacker might impersonate a loan officer at a bank and call customers offering them a lower interest rate on their credit card. They'll tell the customers that they simply need to provide their account details to claim the deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tailgating** is a social engineering tactic in which unauthorized people follow an authorized person into a restricted area. This technique is also sometimes referred to as piggybacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Watering** hole is a type of attack when a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users. Oftentimes, these watering hole sites are infected with malicious software. An example is the Holy Water attack of 2020 that infected various religious, charity, and volunteer websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attackers might use any of these techniques to gain unauthorized access to an organization. Everyone is vulnerable to them, from entry-level employees to senior executives. However, you can reduce the risks of social engineering attacks at any business by teaching others what to expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encouraging caution\n",
    "\n",
    "Spreading awareness usually starts with comprehensive security training. When it comes to social engineering, there are three main areas to focus on when teaching others:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stay alert** of suspicious communications and unknown people, especially when it comes to email. For example, look out for spelling errors and double-check the sender's name and email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be cautious** about sharing information, especially over social media. Threat actors often search these platforms for any information they can use to their advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control curiosity** when something seems too good to be true. This can include wanting to click on attachments or links in emails and advertisements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro tip: Implementing technologies like firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), block lists, email filtering, and others helps layers the defenses should someone make a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, security training extends beyond employees. Educating customers about social engineering threats is also a key to mitigating these threats. And security analysts play an important part in promoting safe practices. For example, a big part of an analyst's job is testing systems and documenting best practices for others at an organization to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "People’s willingness to help one another and their trusting nature is what makes social engineering such an appealing tactic for criminals. It just takes one act of kindness or a momentary lapse in judgment for an attack to work. Criminals go to great lengths to make their attacks difficult to detect. They rely on a variety of manipulation techniques to trick their targets into granting them access. For that reason, implementing effective controls and recognizing the signs of an attack go a long way towards preventing threats."

    "## Types of phishing\n",
    "\n",
    "Phishing is one of the most common types of social engineering, which are manipulation techniques that exploit human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Previously, you learned how phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, phishing attacks appear to come from a trusted person or business. This can lead unsuspecting recipients into acting against their better judgment, causing them to break security procedures. In this reading, you’ll learn about common phishing tactics used by attackers today.\n",
    "Sensitive assets being taken from a computer by various fish hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The origins of phishing\n",
    "\n",
    "Phishing has been around since the early days of the internet. It can be traced back to the 1990s. At the time, people across the world were coming online for the first time. As the internet became more accessible it began to attract the attention of malicious actors. These malicious actors realized that the internet gave them a level of anonymity to commit their crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Early persuasion tactics\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the earliest instances of phishing was aimed at a popular chat service called AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). Users of the service began receiving emails asking them to verify their accounts or provide personal billing information. The users were unaware that these messages were sent by malicious actors pretending to be service providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was one of the first examples of mass phishing, which describes attacks that send malicious emails out to a large number of people, increasing the likelihood of baiting someone into the trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the AIM attacks, malicious actors carefully crafted emails that appeared to come directly from AOL. The messages used official logos, colors, and fonts to trick unsuspecting users into sharing their information and account details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attackers used the stolen information to create fraudulent AOL accounts they could use to carry out other crimes anonymously. AOL was forced to adapt their security policies to address these threats. The chat service began including messages on their platforms to warn users about phishing attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How phishing has evolved\n",
    "Phishing continued evolving at the turn of the century as businesses and newer technologies began entering the digital landscape. In the early 2000s, e-commerce and online payment systems started to become popular alternatives to traditional marketplaces. The introduction of online transactions presented new opportunities for attackers to commit crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of techniques began to appear around this time period, many of which are still used today. There are five common types of phishing that every security analyst should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Email phishing** is a type of attack sent via email in which threat actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smishing** is a type of phishing that uses Short Message Service (SMS), a technology that powers text messaging. Smishing covers all forms of text messaging services, including Apple’s iMessages, WhatsApp, and other chat mediums on phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vishing** refers to the use of voice calls or voice messages to trick targets into providing personal information over the phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spear phishing** is a subset of email phishing in which specific people are purposefully targeted, such as the accountants of a small business.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Whaling** refers to a category of spear phishing attempts that are aimed at high-ranking executives in an organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the early days of phishing, email attacks remain the most common types that are used. While they were originally used to trick people into sharing access credentials and credit card information, email phishing became a popular method to infect computer systems and networks with malicious software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In late 2003, attackers around the world created fraudulent websites that resembled businesses like eBay and PayPal™. Mass phishing campaigns to distribute malicious programs were also launched against e-commerce and banking sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recent trends\n",
    "Starting in the 2010s, attackers began to shift away from mass phishing attempts that relied on baiting unsuspecting people into a trap. Leveraging new technologies, criminals began carrying out what’s known as targeted phishing attempts. Targeted phishing describes attacks that are sent to specific targets using highly customized methods to create a strong sense of familiarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A type of targeted phishing that evolved in the 2010s is angler phishing. **Angler phishing** is a technique where attackers impersonate customer service representatives on social media. This tactic evolved from people’s tendency to complain about businesses online. Threat actors intercept complaints from places like message boards or comment sections and contact the angry customer via social media. Like the AIM attacks of the 1990s, they use fraudulent accounts that appear similar to those of actual businesses. They then trick the angry customers into sharing sensitive information with the promise of fixing their problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Phishing tactics have become very sophisticated over the years. Unfortunately, there isn't a perfect solution that prevents these attacks from happening. Tactics, like email phishing that started in the last century, remain an effective and profitable method of attack for criminals online today.\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn’t a technological solution to prevent phishing entirely. However, there are many ways to reduce the damage from these attacks when they happen. One way is to spread awareness and inform others. As a security professional, you may be responsible for helping others identify forms of social engineering, like phishing. For example, you might create training programs that educate employees about topics like phishing. Sharing your knowledge with others is an important responsibility that helps build a culture of security."
