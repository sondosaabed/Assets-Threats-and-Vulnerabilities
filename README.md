# Assets-Threats-and-Vulnerabilities
In this course, I build an understanding of the wide range of assets organizations must protect. Explored many of the most common security controls used to protect valuable assets from risk. Also discovered the variety of ways assets are vulnerable to threats by adopting an attacker mindset.

## Modules
### Module 1: Introduction to asset security
Introduced to how organizations determine what assets to protect. Learned about the connection between managing risk and classifying assets by exploring the unique challenge of securing physical and digital assets. Introduced to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

### Module 2: Protect organizational assets
Focus on security controls that protect organizational assets. Explored how privacy impacts asset security and understand the role that encryption plays in maintaining the privacy of digital assets. Explored how authentication and authorization systems help verify a userâ€™s identity.

### Module 3: Vulnerabilities in systems
Build an understanding of the vulnerability management process. Learned about common vulnerabilities and develop an attacker mindset by examining the ways vulnerabilities can become threats to asset security if they are exploited.

### Module 4: Threats to asset security
Explored common types of threats to digital asset security. Examine the tools and techniques used by cybercriminals to target assets. In addition, introduced to the threat modeling process and learn ways security professionals stay ahead of security breaches.
